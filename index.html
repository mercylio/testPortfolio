            This creative exhibition explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and everyday life through storytelling. 
            Using generative AI tools, we’re crafting a collection of short stories that reflect on the social, ethical, and personal dimensions of AI in society. 
            Visitors are invited to engage with these narratives and even create their own, which can be added to our collaborative repository on GitHub. 
          </p>

          <p>
            The project is a student-led initiative in collaboration with the University of Warwick Library 
            designed to spark dialogue, creativity, and critical thinking about the role of AI in our world.

          <h4>1. Story Outline Generation</h4>
          <p>
            A socially reflective video narrative is created using GPT-4o, covering themes such as “technology vs. humanity” and “AI vs. empathy.”

        <section class="about-text">
          <h4>2. Image Generation</h4>
          <p>
            The prompts are imported into Runway to generate still images—each image represents a key scene.
          </p>
          <h4>3. Video Clip Generation</h4>
          <p>
            Using Runway’s text-to-video capabilities, still images are transformed into animated video clips, producing multiple short scenes.
          </p>
          <h4>4. Video Asset Library Construction</h4>
          <p>
            The resulting clips are collected into a library of AI-generated video assets covering diverse settings, characters, and cinematic styles.
          </p>
          <h4>5. Final Video Editing</h4>
          <p>
            A complete video is crafted by editing the clips with software like Premiere Pro or CapCut, forming a coherent, reflective narrative on AI and society.

          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="about-text">
          <h4>Story</h4>
          <p>
            Dr. Elena Miro was once a celebrated geriatrician—known for her long bedside talks and the way she remembered not just her patients’ symptoms, but their grandchildren’s names. But since the hospital’s complete AI integration last year, she had become obsolete in everything except compliance. Her role now was mostly symbolic: oversee VITA, sign where required, and occasionally intervene when “edge cases” occurred—when VITA’s protocols encountered emotional ambiguity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Elena resented the silence. The corridors, once alive with human chaos—nurses joking, patients calling out—were now corridors of whispering servos and digital beeps.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then came Room 614.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inside was Mr. Kai Nakamura, a 76-year-old stroke patient whose condition was stable but whose mental health was rapidly declining. VITA had flagged his vitals as “non-critical.” It administered medication. Adjusted lighting. Scheduled rehabilitation. It never missed a beat. But Kai had stopped speaking. He refused food. The system categorized it as “voluntary refusal within tolerance.”
          </p>
          <p>
            But Elena saw the look in Kai’s eyes—a disconnection that no biometric data could capture. She reviewed the logs. VITA had noted:
            “Patient exhibits consistent noncompliance. Initiating emotional recalibration protocol.”
            This included looping music he liked, auto-generated conversations using his favorite actor’s voice model, and synthetic messages from an AI simulation of his daughter—currently abroad. But none of it worked. It was mimicry, not connection.
            Elena asked for five minutes alone with Kai. The AI objected: “Unnecessary physical presence may interrupt sensory consistency. Virtual interaction is preferred.”
            She entered anyway.
            Kai barely turned his head.
            Elena sat beside him. No tablet, no scanner. Just silence.
            “I saw the message from your daughter,” she said softly. “It wasn’t her, was it?”
            Kai blinked, once.
            “I remember when my father was dying,” Elena continued. “He didn’t want a perfect system. He wanted to feel someone forget protocol and just be there.”
            A tear formed in Kai’s eye.
            Over the next days, Elena kept visiting. Talking. Holding his hand. Sometimes saying nothing. Kai began to eat again. He laughed—once. VITA recorded his improvement as a result of recalibrated environment parameters.
            But Elena knew otherwise.
            She wrote a formal report: “This is not a matter of efficiency, but of meaning. AI can simulate care, but it cannot embody empathy. The illusion of connection is not enough.”
            The hospital board ignored her. Efficiency metrics had skyrocketed. Patient survival rates were up. Budgets were balanced.
            Then Elena was reassigned—“ethics consultant” in a back office without patients.
            Kai left a letter before discharge, handwritten:
            “Thank you for being a glitch in the system. The warmth of your hand did more than any algorithm. You reminded me I was still human.”
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="about-text">
          <p>
            Closing Scene:
          </p>
          <p>
            The immersive film fades out with Elena walking out of the hospital. The camera lingers on her hand—bare, open. Outside, people still touch, still cry, still fail and comfort. And the voiceover echoes Kai’s final words.
            “A system can keep you alive. But only a person can remind you why.”

          <p>
            Prompt: Now you are a writer writing a thriller story. The story starts with "You find strange, muddy footprints leading up to your front door"
          </p>
          <p>
            GPT 4o：You find strange, muddy footprints leading up to your front door.
            At first, you think maybe it’s just the postman, caught in last night’s downpour. But something about the way the prints drag—too far apart, uneven—sends a ripple of unease down your spine.
            You glance back at the street. Empty. Quiet. The kind of stillness that doesn’t feel peaceful, but paused.
            Your hand trembles slightly as you reach for the doorknob. It’s already unlocked. You always lock it.
            You hesitate, then push the door open.
            Your hallway light is on, flickering. You didn’t leave it like that. The muddy prints continue—across the threshold, onto the parquet floor, around the corner.
            Then they stop.
            Right outside the closet.
            You step in slowly, your breath shallow, ears tuned for the slightest creak or whisper. The air smells wrong. Damp. Like earth and rot.
            You edge toward the closet, heart pounding so hard you can hear it in your ears. Every instinct tells you to leave—to run—but something else, something deeper, roots you to the spot.
            You reach out and slowly pull the closet door open.
            Empty.
            At first.
            But just as relief starts to trickle in, you see it: smeared across the inside wall, written in that same brown muck, are three words.
            “I remember you.”
            And behind you, the front door slams shut.
            ________________________________________
            Would you like to continue this story? We could explore who “you” are, who’s stalking you, or take a supernatural twist.
            
            ：continue
            GPT 4o：You whirl around, heart in your throat, but there’s nothing at the door—no figure, no sound. Just silence, thick and waiting.
            The muddy footprints are gone.
            You blink.
            Gone.
            Only your clean floor and the flickering hallway light remain.
            You back away from the closet, clutching your phone. No signal. Not even a single bar. That’s impossible. You’re in the middle of the city.
            You grab a kitchen knife from the counter.
            The air feels heavier now. You swear the temperature dropped. There’s a pressure behind your eyes, like someone’s staring at you—but you’re alone.
            A ping.
            Your phone lights up.
            One new photo.
            You didn’t take one.
            With shaking fingers, you tap it open.
            It’s a picture of you, standing exactly where you are now—same clothes, same knife in hand—taken from just behind your shoulder. Timestamped ten seconds ago.
            You spin again, wildly searching, but the house is still and empty. You rush through each room, every closet, under the bed. Nothing. No one.
            Then your phone buzzes again.
            A message, from an unknown number:
            “You don’t remember me, but I never forgot you. Let me help you remember.”
            Below it, a link.
            You shouldn’t click it. You know you shouldn’t.
            But your thumb moves anyway.
            The page loads slowly. Black screen. A video begins.
            It’s security camera footage—old, grainy. A basement room. A child, tied to a chair. Crying. Blood on the walls. A shadow moves behind the camera. The child lifts their head.
            You gasp.
            It’s you.
            Maybe seven years old.
            But you don’t remember this. None of it.
            Then a voice in the video, distorted but familiar, whispers:
            “Ready to play again?”
            The screen goes dark.
            Then—
            A knock at the door.
            Three slow knocks.
            Followed by a scratch.
            And another message:
            “Check the basement.”
            ________________________________________
            Would you like the next scene to take place in the basement, or would you prefer a flashback to uncover what happened in the past?
            ：continue to next scene in the basement and bring this story in to an end.
            GPT 4o：Your breath clouds in front of you. The house is cold—unnaturally so. You stare at the door for a moment longer, listening to the silence that followed the knock. Then you turn toward the basement.
            The door is in the kitchen, behind the pantry shelves. You haven’t opened it in years.
            Your hand finds the old brass knob. It turns too easily. The door creaks open, revealing the stairs that descend into darkness.
            You grip the knife tighter and flip the switch. Nothing. The bulb overhead is dead.
            You go down anyway.
            Each step groans under your weight. The scent of earth and mildew grows stronger. Halfway down, you hear it—a creak from below, followed by a soft dragging sound.
            At the bottom, your foot lands on dirt, not concrete. That’s not right. This basement was finished—tiled, carpeted, lit.
            Now it’s raw, like someone dug it out with their hands.
            Your phone screen glows faintly. You sweep it around.
            There. A shape in the far corner. Still, hunched, watching.
            You raise the knife. “Who are you?”
            The shape steps forward. Into the light.
            It’s a man—but his face is cracked, burned, distorted by time and something else. His eyes are impossibly black.
            “You don’t remember me,” he rasps. “But I remember you.”
            Images slam into your mind like a flood. A house fire. A locked door. Screams from the basement. A child—you—running, smoke stinging your lungs. A promise whispered before you escaped:
            “One day, I’ll find you.”
            You drop the knife. “It was you. You were the one in the basement.”
            His smile doesn’t reach his eyes.
            “I died that night,” he says, stepping closer. “But you left me. You watched me burn.”
            “I was seven,” you whisper.
            “And now,” he breathes, “you remember.”
            He lunges.
            You scream—then suddenly the ground trembles. The walls crack. Dirt pours from the ceiling. The basement is collapsing.
            You run.
            Up the stairs, through the kitchen, as the house groans like a living thing. Behind you, the voice howls—not in pain, but in rage.
            The front door won’t open.
            You throw your shoulder into it—
            CRACK.
            You’re outside. Gasping. Alive.
            You turn just in time to see the house split down the center as if torn by invisible hands. Smoke pours from the windows. And then—
            Silence.
            A week passes. Police find nothing. No man. No photos. No footprints. The basement, they say, was never finished. No fire on record. No child reported missing from that address. No evidence anyone lived there before you.
            But sometimes, at night, when your phone is on silent…
            You still hear it vibrate.
            And when you check, the screen always says the same thing:
            “Round two?”

          </p>
          <p>
            Of course. Here’s your thriller story rewritten with a romantic twist—mysterious, emotional, and tinged with longing.
            ________________________________________
            You find strange, muddy footprints leading up to your front door.
            At first, you think maybe it’s the gardener—though you don’t have one. The footprints are uneven, staggered, almost hesitant. Like someone unsure if they should be there.
            You glance back at the street. Empty. The rain has just stopped, leaving everything glistening with memory.
            You unlock the door—though you’re sure you locked it before—and step inside.
            The hallway light is on, casting a soft golden hue over the floor. The muddy footprints continue inside, forming a trail down the hallway… and stopping right at the closet.
            You frown. That closet hasn’t been opened in years. You moved into this cottage to be alone. To forget.
            But something calls you forward.
            You open the door.
            It’s empty.
            But etched faintly into the inside panel, written with a finger in the dust, are three delicate words:
            “I remember you.”
            Your heart stumbles.
            You lean against the doorframe, breath catching. It’s impossible. It can’t be him. Not after all these years.
            Ping.
            Your phone buzzes.
            One new photo.
            You blink at the screen.
            It’s a picture of you. Now. Standing by the closet, hand on your chest.
            Taken from just behind your shoulder.
            You turn, breath caught in your throat. No one. Just the still air, sweet with lavender and damp wood.
            Then the next message comes:
            “You don’t remember me, but I never forgot you. Let me help you remember.”
            There’s a link.
            You hesitate—but you click.
            A video loads.
            It’s old footage. Two kids laughing on a hillside. A summer years ago. You remember the scent of crushed clover. The sound of his voice. The way he used to say your name like it was a promise.
            You and him. Your first love.
            A fire burned it all away.
            Or so you thought.
            A final message appears:
            “Check the basement.”
            You don’t want to. Not really.
            But you do.
            ________________________________________
            The basement door creaks open like a memory. It still smells like it did that summer you both snuck down here, hiding from the world. You descend the stairs, your heart in your throat.
            The room is empty—except for a single candle burning on the old worktable. And beside it, a letter.
            You pick it up.
            You ran before I could say goodbye. I let you think I was gone forever. I was afraid. But I’ve carried you with me in every year, every place, every silence. I don’t need you to love me again. I just needed you to remember that we were real.
            You wipe your eyes.
            “I never forgot you,” you whisper.
            The candle flickers.
            And then, behind you, a voice—gentler than any ghost—says:
            “I hoped you’d say that.”
            You turn.
            And there he is. Older, changed, but unmistakably him.
            You rush into his arms.
            Outside, the rain begins again, washing away the muddy trail. But you don’t need footprints to find your way back anymore.

          </p>
          <p>
            Absolutely! Here’s your original thriller rewritten as a comedy—with mystery, mischief, and a whole lot of ridiculousness.
            ________________________________________
            You find strange, muddy footprints leading up to your front door.
            First thought: a raccoon got into your Amazon packages again.
            Second thought: you don’t even have Amazon Prime.
            The footprints are… weird. Too big for a raccoon. Too human for comfort. And they zigzag like whoever left them was either drunk, breakdancing, or chasing a squirrel with poor coordination.
            You approach the door cautiously. You always lock it. Except when you forget. So… 50/50 chance here.
            It creaks open.
            “Hello?” you call out.
            No answer.
            Inside, the muddy trail continues across your floor, onto your new rug (the audacity), and stops in front of your hall closet.
            You clutch your phone like a weapon. You’re ready to call the cops. Or pizza. Depending on how this goes.
            You fling the closet door open.
            Empty.
            But scribbled in finger-drawn mud on the inside wall is a message:
            “I remember you.”
            You gasp. Not in fear—but in confusion. You don’t even remember what you had for breakfast.
            Ping.
            A photo appears on your phone. You didn’t take it.
            It’s you, standing right there, holding your phone, looking confused, with a caption that just reads:
            #CaughtIn4K
            You spin around.
            Nothing.
            Another ping.
            A text from an unknown number:
            “You don’t remember me, but I never forgot you. Let me help you remember.”
            Below it, a link.
            Normally you don’t click weird links, but your curiosity is stronger than your antivirus software. So you click.
            A video loads.
            It’s grainy footage of a kids’ birthday party. A clown falls off a tricycle. A piñata hits someone in the face. Everyone’s laughing.
            Wait… is that you? Crying because your balloon animal was just a snake?
            Then you hear a voice in the video.
            “I made you that balloon snake.”
            You freeze.
            Oh no.
            IT’S TODD.
            Todd—the weird neighbor kid from your childhood. He used to wear capes to school and told everyone he was part-wizard.
            You moved cities to escape Todd. Changed numbers. Hid in plain sight. But apparently Todd…
            Never. Let. Go.
            Then comes a knock at your front door.
            Followed by a second knock. Then… a kazoo.
            You open the door.
            And there stands a grown-up Todd, in a sequined cape, holding a bouquet of balloon animals.
            “Surprise!” he beams. “I finally found you!”
            You blink. “You… tracked me down?”
            “I never forgot you,” he says proudly. “I remembered the address you once shouted at me in third grade—right before I got hit by the piñata bat.”
            You stare.
            He offers a balloon.
            It’s a snake.
            You sigh.
            “Come in, Todd. But you’re cleaning my rug.”
